# How to Host a Resume While Learning Technical Writing Principles Along the Way 

In this README, steps will be described in order to show you how to host your resume on Github while referring to Andrew Etter’s book: Modern Technical Writing. The general principles listed in the book allows you to not only host your resume, but to get a better understanding of the importance of certain steps and to provide you with tools you can use along the way. By the end of this, you should be ready to host your own resume on Github!

## Getting Started

These instructions are intended for computer science students looking to learn how to host their resumes online, and at the same time, seeing the benefits in doing so. 

### Prerequisites

So the first thing you should have to get started is a resume formatted in Markdown. Markdown is a markup language that is great for documents like this. It’s recommended because of how tedious other files can be. In our case, take your resume. If not in markup language, it’s commonly a text document converted into a pdf. But what happens when you want to edit your resume? Now you have to discard the previous pdf and replace it with a new one. It’s single use and hardly efficient. That’s where Markdown and Github come in. Etter has mentioned that documentation should live online and he’s right. This way, updates are made instantly and you don’t have to convert files or throw them away.  

Benefits of Markdown:  
-	Easy to learn
-	Can be used in almost any documentation tool
-	Works well in formatting your documents

For more on Markdown, go to [resources](#more-resources).  

Next, you will need a Github account. This account will be where you host your resume. Github is an example of a distributive version control system(DVCS). This is another tool that allows us to make those updates I mentioned so easily. Github gives you free hosting pages which acts like a website to your resume. Using a DVCS is another step in Etter's book.

## Instructions
Alright, now that we've got those out of the way, we can proceed with the main activity.  

1. Make a Repository  
   Name the repository: [yourUser].github.io  
   This is Github's free hosting page. They give you the page if you have that in the repository name. 
2. Upload your Resume  
   In the main branch, have you resume uploaded. 
3. Add a yml File  
   This is a file that will allow you to customize your theme using jekyll themes.

## FAQ

- Why is Markdown better than a word processor?  
Markdown is better because of it's simplicity. Word has many formatting options, meanwhile Markdown has just what you need in documentation. It's also very easy to learn which is a bonus!

- Why is my resume not showing up?  
  Your resume may not appear immediately after getting hosted. You may have to wait for a few minutes or longer for it to show up on the Github pages.
